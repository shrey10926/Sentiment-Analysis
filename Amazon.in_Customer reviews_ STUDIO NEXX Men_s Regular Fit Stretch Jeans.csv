  Good fitting. Nice look.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect fit, well made.","Right now it's hard to get a standard regular fit with all these newfangled design names like ""carrot fit"" which frankly I don't even understand what they are trying to convey.

This is perfect regular fit, with decent stretch material.

Time will tell how well made it is."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good at 1st trial,but.......","
  The jeans looked good,were comfortable to wear when tried on.But,when wore for an outing,the elastic-stretch was so weak that it kept slipping down...inspiteof wearing the belt!Disappointed,over-all.Ordered 3 more initially,but,had to cancel the order,regretfully.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,"
  Reading the reviews it was with trepidation that i ordered these jeans. they are very good in terms of thickness of cloth, stitching and finish. Look a lot like Levis, but at an affordable rate.
"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Quality,"
  Quality of stitching is not good. Threads are coming out after first wash. Quality of Denim also not good. It looks like very old like denim which looks after several wash & bleach. I can not return as I lost the tags. I have faced same issue with all three pants I purchased.
"

"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Studio Nexx Jeans Regular fit,"
  The fabric is very thin as compared to branded jeans of Lee, Pepe etc. The fitting is of average quality. The fabric doesn't strech as much as expected. You should opt for this product only if don't want to spend a high price. If better fit provided at this price then it will be value for money.
"

"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Felt like a used jeans,"
  I felt this like a used jeans. Its because the thread came of the cloth, particularly in pocket, which will be result of a normal use by someone. Stitching is also very ordinary and thread is out there as well. If i haven't cut the stickers, i would have send it back for refund.
"
