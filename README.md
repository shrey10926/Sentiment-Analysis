## Lessons Learned


How to deal with text based data was unknown to me for a long time and so with the help of this project I finally made my acquiantance with NLP! 

The biggest challenge was to identify which keywords caused the review to be negative or positive. Sure I could create a wordcloud of the negative and positive reviews but it would only give me the most frequent appearig words in the corpus. Not much useful so I had to find another way. Eventually I came across model interpreatbility libraries like Shap and Lime. I used Shap for global interpretation and Lime for local interpretation which finally gave me the keywords which were responsible for classifying negative or positive reviews.

## Optimizations

To improve my baseline model, I used NestedCV to get a robust estimate of my model. Also I used RandomizedSearchCV inside the NestedCV to tune the hyperparameters of all the models I tried (9 to be precise).

Also before feeding the data to the model, I removed all the smileys and emoticons from the corpus.
